Using SFML 2.5.1

Notes:


 - In order to run more than one client follow
 the below steps but run the client.exe more
 than once and repeat the steps related to
 the client's rendering window for all players.
 
 
 - There can only be multiple players in the
 game if the client and executable are run on
 the same PC. To have multiple players across
 separate machines the source code for the
 client must be opened and the 3 instances of
 sf::IpAddress::getLocalAddress() must be
 replaced with the address of the server (which
 should be printed in the first line of the
 console when it is run) in the format of a
 string i.e. ["x.x.x.x"]. The program can then
 be compiled and steps 3-6 can be followed.

 Instructions:
 
 
1. Run the server.exe.

2. Run the client.exe.

3. Clicking the LMB on the "PLAY GAME" button
 in the client rendering window will start
 the game.
 
4. Move the character using WASD in each respective
 direction. Moving the cursor around the 
 screen rotates the player.
 
5. Pressing the space bar will stop the game
 and exit to the main menu.
 
6. Clicking the LMB on the "QUIT" button in
 the client rendering window will exit the
 game.
 
7. To close the server click the close button
 at the top right corner of the console using
 the LMB.
